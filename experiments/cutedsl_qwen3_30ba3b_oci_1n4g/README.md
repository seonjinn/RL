# Qwen3-30B-A3B CuTeDSL OCI-HSG 1n4g gate

This experiment is the first Linux/GB200 gate for the CuTeDSL fused grouped-MLP policy-training slice. It runs three synchronous GRPO steps on one OCI-HSG node with four GPUs, including Megatron-to-HF export and rollout refit. No GPU run has been performed from this worktree yet.

## NeMo 26.06 two-node factorial harness

`submit_nemo2606_2n4g_factorial.sh` adds the portable performance path. It submits the repository `ray.sub` launcher, whose head process starts the Ray GCS, whose second-node task joins as a Ray worker, and whose driver starts only after all eight `worker_units` are visible. The matrix payload switches to existing-Ray mode, so it executes directly in the head container and never starts a nested one-task local Ray cluster. The locked driver environment and result artifacts use the shared repository filesystem, while per-node Ray actor environments use a run-scoped node-local `/tmp` root to avoid concurrent rebuilds of one shared venv.

The fixed workload is Qwen3-30B-A3B on two GB200 nodes with four GPUs per node, TP1/PP1/CP1/ETP1/EP8, GBS16, and MBS1. World-size-derived DP8 therefore receives two local microbatches, the minimum useful combined-1F1B A2A-overlap shape. Each timing arm runs five warmup plus twenty measured updates. Four `(full-CG, A2A)` contexts each run an alternating CuTeDSL OFF/ON pair for at least three replicas, covering all eight binary-factor cells without duplicating the existing timing extractor or replicate collector.

Use the same command on Pre-Tyche, Lyris, or AWS-DFW by selecting a cluster profile:

```bash
CUTEDSL_CLUSTER_PROFILE=pre_tyche \
  ./experiments/cutedsl_qwen3_30ba3b_oci_1n4g/submit_nemo2606_2n4g_factorial.sh --test-only
```

The default contexts are `g0a0,g1a0,g0a1,g1a1`. For the current CuTeDSL-only branch, use `NEMO2606_FACTORIAL_CONTEXTS=g0a0` to validate only baseline versus CuTeDSL. A2A contexts fail before training unless the source contains both the NeMo-RL schedule-plan adapter and Bridge/MCore config propagation. Full-CG contexts additionally fail when the source still rejects colocated generation/refit: EP8 consumes all eight GPUs in a 2x4 allocation, so the current non-colocated-only full-CG slice needs either colocated support or extra generation GPUs. This is an explicit remaining functional gate; the harness never records a silent no-op full-CG result.

Each context writes a separate submission JSONL. Run `collect_cutedsl_ab_replicates.py` once per context JSONL against the common `results/` root. The collector retains the existing E2E, generation, generation-finalize, logprob, policy-training, refit, and normalized-throughput series. Its current aggregation scope is only the context-local CuTeDSL OFF/ON pair; it does not yet calculate cross-context full-CG or A2A main effects and interactions. Those effects require a follow-up factorial aggregate over the four accepted context summaries before any full-CG/A2A speedup claim. The manifest records this limitation explicitly. Profile jobs are separate from accepted timing samples and fail closed unless CuTeDSL ON/OFF kernel attribution passes; enabled full-CG contexts additionally require policy-worker `cudaGraphLaunch` evidence, and enabled A2A contexts require NCCL A2A kernel evidence. Raw artifact listings are capped at 200 paths and Nsight reports at 16 per arm.

The wrapper does not accept a container override. The pinned nightly was staged by job `4677250`. Its baked environment is older than this branch, so the wrapper creates a locked Python 3.13.13 MCore environment in node-local storage before validation. If that compatibility build fails, classify it separately from policy-training failures. Do not overwrite the dated image.

## Preflight and scheduling check

Use a pushed branch on the OCI-HSG checkout. Before asking SLURM to schedule it:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
git status --short --branch
git submodule status --recursive
git rev-parse '@{upstream}'
git rev-parse HEAD
sbatch --test-only experiments/cutedsl_qwen3_30ba3b_oci_1n4g/submit_oci_hsg.sh
```

`sbatch --test-only` parses the fixed resource request without executing the wrapper or consuming GPUs. Resolve account, partition, GRES, or feasibility errors before submitting.

The wrapper requires a configured upstream, requires `HEAD == @{upstream}`, rejects tracked changes and non-ignored untracked files, and requires every recursive submodule to be initialized and clean. Push the parent and Bridge branches before this preflight.

The runtime wrapper rejects tracked parent or submodule changes. It then hashes the image, creates a run-local Linux uv environment, and performs these gates in order:

1. Install the locked MCore, test, and dev groups with `uv sync --locked`, then run `uv lock --check`.
2. Record source/upstream, recursive submodule, image, runtime, topology, and resolved-config provenance.
3. Run the official Bridge parameter-mapping/checkpointing suites and the three focused NeMo-RL suites.
4. Run `pyrefly check`, parent pre-commit over the changed parent files, and Bridge pre-commit over the changed Bridge files.
5. Run the required Cutlass DSL `python -c` import.
6. Execute a Transformer Engine `Linear` forward and backward with finite output/input/parameter-gradient checks on each of the four visible GPUs.
7. Run three GRPO steps, persist Ray logs under the result directory, and capture the step-2 Megatron policy worker with Nsight Systems.
8. Export TensorBoard scalars to `metrics.json` and enforce explicit successful optimizer updates, finite loss/gradients, MXFP8 rollout/refit parity, non-empty post-warmup timing/throughput, and `.mem_gb` peak-memory metrics.

These validations are requirements of the job; they are not claimed as passing until the OCI job executes successfully.

## Submit and monitor

```bash
JOB_ID=$(sbatch --parsable experiments/cutedsl_qwen3_30ba3b_oci_1n4g/submit_oci_hsg.sh)
RUN_DIR="experiments/cutedsl_qwen3_30ba3b_oci_1n4g/results/${JOB_ID}"
echo "${JOB_ID} ${RUN_DIR}"
squeue -j "${JOB_ID}" -o '%.18i %.2t %.10M %.6D %R'
tail -F "${RUN_DIR}/slurm.out"
```

On requeue, the result directory is `$JOB_ID-r$SLURM_RESTART_COUNT`. Discover every attempt safely with:

```bash
find experiments/cutedsl_qwen3_30ba3b_oci_1n4g/results \
  -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "${JOB_ID}*" -print | sort
```

Poll the queue and tail the run log frequently for at least five minutes after the job starts. Model download and kernel compilation can be slow; cancel only for a confirmed unrecoverable error.

## Run artifacts

All generated output stays under `results/$RUN_ID/` (`$JOB_ID` initially or the requeue suffix documented above), which is ignored by Git.

## Classification and acceptance

Classify missing Cutlass DSL, TE, cuDNN frontend, CUDA, binary symbols, container imports/mounts, or insufficient runtime versions as image/runtime failures. Classify config validation, model shape, refit tensor mismatch, loss divergence, and exceptions in the changed Python path as code failures. Use the systematic-debugging workflow for code failures; do not change the image to mask them.

The gate passes only when the wrapper completes and review confirms all of the following:

- At least two `train/optimizer_update_successful == 1` entries were logged; loss-row count is not used as an optimizer-update proxy.
- Megatron-to-HF export and rollout refit completed without shape or layout errors.
- The repository's existing GB200 MXFP8 rollout/refit parity metrics pass: `max(train/gen_kl_error) < 0.05` and `max(train/token_mult_prob_error) < 2.0`. These exact thresholds come from `tests/functional/grpo_vllm_mxfp8_rollout_gb200.sh`; they are proxy metrics for rollout/refit parity, not a claim of elementwise logit equality.
- Loss and gradient norms are finite.
- `kernel_evidence.txt` or the retained Nsight capture identifies the CuTeDSL fused grouped-MLP kernel, not only the generic op-fuser path.
- Non-empty post-warmup policy timing and policy tokens/s series are present, and peak GPU memory is recorded from Ray logger keys ending in `.mem_gb`.

If functional checks pass but kernel evidence is absent, report the result as functionally passing with performance activation unverified. Do not claim a performance win from this three-update smoke; use at least five measured updates or a repeated microbenchmark for a comparison.
