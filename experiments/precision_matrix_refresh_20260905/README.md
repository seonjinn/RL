# Precision Matrix Refresh

This experiment compares four precision arms on one pinned NeMo-RL source
revision. Each model and execution mode keeps its workload, GPU count,
parallelism, and two policy logprob passes fixed across all arms.

| Arm | Policy training | Rollout |
|---|---|---|
| `bf16-bf16` | BF16 | BF16 FlashInfer TRTLLM |
| `bf16-mxfp8` | BF16 | MXFP8 FlashInfer TRTLLM |
| `mxfp8-false-mxfp8` | MXFP8 with BF16 parameters | MXFP8 FlashInfer TRTLLM |
| `mxfp8-true-mxfp8` | MXFP8 with MXFP8 parameters | MXFP8 FlashInfer TRTLLM |

`sync` uses colocated CUDA IPC refit. `async` uses
disaggregated NCCL Reshard refit and keeps the smaller training topology because
generation has separate workers. Qwen3.5 Async reserves one four-node segment
for training and one four-node segment for generation, which keeps the EP16
training group inside one NVLink domain. All runs execute 20 steps; reports use
steps 2-20. Every arm uses the same FlashInfer TRTLLM backend so precision is
the only generation change.

Qwen3.5 performance runs use 128 prompts and 16 generations per prompt, for a
training global batch size of 2048. The launcher applies all three values to
every Qwen3.5 precision arm so BF16 and MXFP8 rollout runs stay matched.
Every arm also uses router dtype `fp32` and GRPO seed `42`; this avoids
comparing the inherited BF16 `fp64` router against MXFP8 training with an
`fp32` router.

Set `QUANT_SCOPE=moe_qkvo` on a Qwen3.5 MXFP8 rollout to quantize full-attention
Q/K/V/O projections in addition to routed experts. Linear-attention modules,
shared experts, routers, vision modules, MTP, and the LM head remain BF16. The
first two and last six layers also remain BF16. The default `QUANT_SCOPE=moe`
keeps all attention projections in BF16.

vLLM 0.25.1 automatic KV-cache accounting can overestimate available memory
after CuMem sleep-pool reclamation. Set `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` to the same
value for every comparison arm when a model needs more wake-up headroom. This
keeps GBS, parallelism, CUDA Graphs, and all workload settings unchanged. The
launcher leaves each recipe's value intact when the variable is unset.
`SUPER_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` remains a compatibility alias for existing Super
commands.

Use the cluster-specific launcher so its scheduler arguments match the target
cluster. OCI requests `batch` and four GPU GRES per node. Ptyche requests
`batch`, and Lyris requests `gb200`; both allocate whole nodes without a GRES
request. Scheduler preflight rejects both clusters when no partition is given.
Lyris Qwen3-235B jobs read the immutable model snapshot from Lustre instead of
copying hundreds of GB into each job's node-local cache. Their dataset, venv,
Ray, and compiler caches still use `/raid/scratch`. Every exclusive allocation
clears only its own node-local run directory before creating the new cache.
Concurrent runs therefore cannot delete each other's source or environment;
durable Lustre logs and results are not removed.

The launcher keeps GPU-local CPU affinity but disables hard NUMA memory binding.
Large policy and reference workers can then use memory from the whole node
instead of exhausting one NUMA node while other host memory remains free. Set
`NRL_DISABLE_NUMA_MEMBIND=0` only for a controlled locality comparison.

Before submission, the launcher packs the clean source tree and all pinned
submodules into one immutable tar file under the durable result root. Each allocated node
extracts that file into its local scratch directory and builds there. Parallel
jobs therefore cannot race while building editable Megatron-Core extensions
from one shared source checkout.

This refresh pins Megatron-Bridge `a4d5ead0` and nested Megatron-Core
`bde6af2e`. The latter includes construction-time module-name propagation, so
the TE precision recipe selects BF16 or MXFP8 parameter storage before each
module allocates its weights.

The source overlay intentionally differs from the nightly image's Bridge
revision, while its `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and actor-environment registry
match the image fingerprint. The launcher therefore reuses the image's
prebuilt `/opt/ray_venvs` and places the node-local Bridge and Megatron-LM
source first on `PYTHONPATH`. This avoids resolving unchanged dependencies and
still runs the pinned source revision used by the experiment.

The original Hugging Face weights, venvs, and compiler caches stay node-local,
but `NRL_MEGATRON_CHECKPOINT_DIR` points to the shared converted-checkpoint
cache. All policy ranks can therefore read the `run_config.yaml` and weight
shards produced by the one-time Hugging Face-to-Megatron conversion.

Run one arm on OCI:

```bash
MODEL=qwen30 MODE=async ARM=mxfp8-true-mxfp8 PERFORMANCE_RECIPE=1 ACTION=test-only \
  ./experiments/precision_matrix_refresh_20260905/submit_oci.sh

MODEL=qwen30 MODE=async ARM=mxfp8-true-mxfp8 PERFORMANCE_RECIPE=1 ACTION=submit \
  ./experiments/precision_matrix_refresh_20260905/submit_oci.sh
```

Qwen3.5 EP32 host-memory smoke tests use eight 4-GPU nodes. Run the all-to-all
arm first to isolate the memory effect of EP32, then enable HybridEP with the
same topology to measure dispatcher performance:

```bash
MODEL=qwen35 MODE=sync ARM=bf16-bf16 TOPOLOGY=ep32-alltoall MAX_STEPS=2 \
  ACTION=test-only ./experiments/precision_matrix_refresh_20260905/submit_oci.sh

MODEL=qwen35 MODE=sync ARM=bf16-bf16 TOPOLOGY=ep32-hybridep MAX_STEPS=2 \
  ACTION=test-only ./experiments/precision_matrix_refresh_20260905/submit_oci.sh
```

Submit a matrix by invoking the launcher once per model, mode, and arm. Run
`ACTION=test-only` first. OCI-HSG has all four model caches. Ptyche currently
has Qwen3-30B-A3B, Nemotron 3.5 Lightning, and Qwen3.5-35B-A3B caches. Verify
the requested model cache before using the Lyris launcher.
