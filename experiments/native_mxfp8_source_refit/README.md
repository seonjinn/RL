# Native MXFP8 Source Refit

This task-owned experiment compares BF16 parameter storage (`fp8_param=false`)
with native MXFP8 parameter storage (`fp8_param=true`) on the same
non-colocated NCCL Reshard topology. The launcher does not submit work unless
`ACTION=submit` is selected.

The five configurations are resolved from the repository's baseline GRPO
configuration and retain their task-owned model geometry:

| Model | Configuration | Nodes x GPUs | Segment |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | `qwen30-fp8param-false.yaml` | 4 x 4 | 2 |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | `qwen30-fp8param-true.yaml` | 4 x 4 | 2 |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B QKVO + routed MoE | `qwen30-fp8param-true-qkvo.yaml` | 4 x 4 | 2 |
| Nemotron-3 Nano | `nano-fp8param-false.yaml` | 8 x 4 | 4 |
| Nemotron-3 Nano | `nano-fp8param-true.yaml` | 8 x 4 | 4 |

The native TE files order routed `linear_fc1` and `linear_fc2` MXFP8 matchers
before a BF16 catch-all and set `fp8_param: true` on the MXFP8 recipe. Nano
additionally holds zero leading layers and the final eight layers in BF16. Its
native smoke must verify that only the routed-expert FC1/FC2 tensors carry E4M3
values plus E8M0 scales; attention, shared experts, router, QKVO, and `lm_head`
remain BF16 entries. `RAY_TMPDIR_ROOT` is exported before `ray.sub`; `ray.sub`
derives the job-scoped scratch directory before starting Ray.

## Environment

`REPO` must be a clean source checkout under `/home`. `CONTAINER`, `HF_HOME`,
and `RESULT_ROOT` must be durable `/lustre` paths; `WANDB_HOME` contains the
credentials under `/home`. The launcher creates worker environments, UV,
vLLM, Triton, Inductor, Ray temporary files, and staged model caches only
under `/raid/scratch/${USER}`. Build caches are keyed by source SHA and model
cache staging is keyed by model, never job ID or run label. The worker
environment is keyed only by source SHA; compiled vLLM, Triton, and Inductor
caches are additionally scoped by the `fp8_param` arm.

The known model cache directories are staged once on each allocated node with
`rsync --ignore-existing`; the launcher does not scan or copy the entire
Hugging Face cache. Durable Slurm logs and requested run artifacts are the only
per-run output under `RESULT_ROOT`.

The experiment branch pins a Megatron-Bridge commit from PR #5917. Until that
commit is upstream, the launcher overrides only the Bridge submodule fetch URL
with `BRIDGE_SUBMODULE_URL` and still checks out the exact gitlink recorded by
the NeMo-RL commit.

## Commands

Render the selected setup without contacting Slurm:

```bash
MODEL=qwen30 FP8_PARAM=true MAX_STEPS=2 ACTION=render \
  ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
```

Run `sbatch --test-only` before each smoke or submission:

```bash
MODEL=qwen30 FP8_PARAM=true MAX_STEPS=2 ACTION=test-only \
  ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
MODEL=nano FP8_PARAM=true MAX_STEPS=2 ACTION=test-only \
  ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
```

The native two-step smoke commands are:

```bash
MODEL=qwen30 FP8_PARAM=true MAX_STEPS=2 ACTION=submit \
  ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
MODEL=nano FP8_PARAM=true MAX_STEPS=2 ACTION=submit \
  ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
MODEL=qwen30-qkvo FP8_PARAM=true MAX_STEPS=2 ACTION=submit \
  ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
```

Run matched 20-step A/B measurements from one clean source SHA:

```bash
MODEL=qwen30 FP8_PARAM=false MAX_STEPS=20 ACTION=submit ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
MODEL=qwen30 FP8_PARAM=true  MAX_STEPS=20 ACTION=submit ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
MODEL=nano   FP8_PARAM=false MAX_STEPS=20 ACTION=submit ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
MODEL=nano   FP8_PARAM=true  MAX_STEPS=20 ACTION=submit ./experiments/native_mxfp8_source_refit/submit_oci_hsg.sh
```

After a submission, use one filtered `squeue -j <job-id>` or `squeue --me`
query no sooner than 60 seconds after the preceding query, for at least five
minutes. Inspect only the submitted job's logs; do not run unfiltered scheduler
queries or recursive scans on shared storage.

## Smoke Gate

The two-step native smoke is accepted only when both steps have finite loss,
reward, entropy, and generation-KL error, and the logs show the native source
route (`fp8_param=true`, `fp8_recipe=mxfp8`, `refit_transport=nccl_reshard`)
with E4M3 values and `torch.uint8` E8M0 scales. It must also prove one vLLM
reload initialization and finalization per refit, no BF16 receiver
quantization for native components, and a Qwen value-changing second refit.

The worker validates native source tensor dtype, compact scale layout, and
swizzled-scale rejection before the collective. Preserve the resolved Hydra
configuration and the native refit metadata from each smoke so the TE storage
scope and destination placement can be checked without inferring them from the
recipe alone.
