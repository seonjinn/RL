# Weight Refit: Choosing a Transport

Weight refit copies updated policy weights into the rollout model. Choose the
topology first, then select one non-colocated transport with
`policy.generation.refit_transport`.

## Pick a Transport

| Topology | `refit_transport` | Transport | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `colocated.enabled: true` | `null` | CUDA IPC | Policy and rollout workers share GPUs; vLLM uses ZMQ plus CUDA IPC handles and SGLang uses Ray CUDA IPC. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `null` | NCCL broadcast | vLLM uses the default full-weight collective; SGLang uses its own weight-update group. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `nccl_reshard` | NCCL reshard | Provides the best performance for large models (>100s B models). |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `vllm_zmq_sparse` | Sparse delta over ZeroMQ | The link is bandwidth-limited and workers can reach a relay over TCP. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `vllm_s3_sparse` | Sparse delta through S3 | Workers communicate through shared object storage. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `nixl` | NIXL checkpoint engine | The cluster has a fast UCX/RDMA fabric for full-weight refit. |

`null` is the default. The sparse transports read only `refit_cfg.sparse`; NIXL
reads only `refit_cfg.nixl`. Because one selector chooses the transport, sparse
delta and NIXL cannot both be active.

## vLLM Reload API

For non-colocated vLLM using the default NCCL transport, set
`policy.generation.vllm_cfg.refit_with_reload_api: true` to install refitted
weights through vLLM's native `reload_weights` API. The flag is off by default.
Use this path when vLLM's post-load processing is required after every refit,
for example `flashinfer_trtllm` MoE models where `process_weights_after_loading`
reshapes expert weight buffers.

Early measurements from this PR show that reload refit can be faster for Llama
8B and Qwen3 32B, while Qwen3 30B-A3B was about 44% slower. MXFP8 reload refit
was about 2x slower in the measured run and used higher peak memory. Leave
additional KV-cache headroom for MXFP8, for example by lowering
`policy.generation.vllm_cfg.gpu_memory_utilization`.

The reload API path currently supports only `policy.generation.backend: vllm`,
`policy.generation.colocated.enabled: false`, and
`policy.generation.refit_transport: null`. It is explicitly unsupported with
`nccl_reshard`, ModelOpt quantization (`policy.generation.quant_cfg`), sparse
refit transports, and checkpoint-engine/NIXL transports. Eagle/MTP draft
weights refitted from the trainer are not supported yet; use the legacy loader
for those cases.

## Constraints

| Transport | Generation backend | Policy backend | Quantization and MoE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colocated CUDA IPC | vLLM or SGLang | DTensor or Megatron | Uses the generation backend's standard loader. |
| NCCL | vLLM or Megatron | DTensor or Megatron | Uses the standard full-weight loader. |
| NCCL + reload API | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Default non-colocated NCCL only. Rejects colocated refit, `nccl_reshard`, sparse delta, NIXL/checkpoint-engine transports, ModelOpt quantization (`real_quant` or `quant_cfg`), Eagle/MTP trainer-refit draft weights, and grouped-MoE MXFP8 slabs. |
| SGLang NCCL weight-update group | SGLang | Megatron | Trainer rank 0 broadcasts finalized HF tensors to the engine leaders. |
| NCCL reshard | vLLM | Megatron | Requires matching BF16 or blockwise FP8 precision; Megatron ETP must be 1. Currently supporting Megatron+vLLM backends. |
| Sparse delta | vLLM | Megatron | BF16/FP16, unquantized rollout only. |
| NIXL, full weights | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Supports the standard full-weight FP8 loader. DTensor FP8 KV-cache scale transfer is not yet supported. |
| NIXL, sharded experts | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Unquantized BF16/FP16 Triton MoE only; FP8/MXFP8 and dynamic expert placement are rejected. |

Non-colocated SGLang generation is supported with a Megatron policy and
`refit_transport: null`; it creates its own NCCL weight-update group. The NIXL
restrictions are on the generation backend; both Megatron and DTensor policy
workers can send weights. vLLM refit also rejects grouped MoE MXFP8 expert
slabs such as `mlp.experts.gate_up_proj` and `mlp.experts.down_proj`. Sparse
delta is currently limited to GRPO. NIXL is
initialized by the GRPO and distillation setup paths; PPO currently requires
colocated generation.

## Performance Options

| Option | Scope | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `policy.generation.vllm_cfg.refit_prequantize` | Megatron training with MXFP8 vLLM rollout | Quantizes eligible weights on the trainer and transfers E4M3 values plus E8M0 scales. Requires `precision: fp8` and `is_mx: true`; sparse delta and NCCL Reshard do not support it. |
| `policy.generation.vllm_cfg.refit_cache_loader_routes` | vLLM refit | Replays identity-validated weight-loader routes after the first refit. Disabled by default because loader behavior is model-dependent. |
| `policy.refit_buffer_size_gb` | Colocated CUDA IPC or non-colocated NCCL broadcast | Sets the packing threshold explicitly. For NCCL broadcast, the same byte value is sent to producer and consumer so their collective chunk boundaries match. |
| `policy.refit_persistent_ipc_buffers` | Colocated CUDA-IPC refit | Reuses the two trainer staging buffers across refits. A fixed `refit_buffer_size_gb` gives stable memory use. |
| `policy.megatron_cfg.refit_slim_offload_after` | Colocated Megatron refit | Avoids repeating grad-buffer offload and a second allocator cleanup after weights are transferred. |
| `policy.megatron_cfg.pinned_reference_swap` | Megatron reference-policy logprobs | Keeps the CPU reference copy in pinned memory for faster host-to-device swaps, at the cost of additional pinned host memory. |

## Minimal Configuration

Colocated refit needs no transport configuration:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: true
    refit_transport: null
```

For non-colocated NCCL, change the topology and leave the selector unset:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: null
```

For NCCL reshard with Megatron policy training and vLLM generation:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: nccl_reshard
```

For sparse delta, select one data plane and configure its scope:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: vllm_zmq_sparse  # or vllm_s3_sparse
    refit_cfg:
      sparse:
        delta_compression:
          encoding: xor
        storage:
          s3_bucket: null  # required for vllm_s3_sparse
```

For NIXL, select the checkpoint engine and configure its scope:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: nixl
    refit_cfg:
      nixl:
        update_weights_bucket_memory_ratio: 0.05
        device: cuda
        backend_name: UCX
        release_after_refit: false
        shard_expert_weights: false
```
