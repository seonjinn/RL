# Span Groups

Span granularity in NeMo-RL is controlled by `span_groups` in the [`telemetry:` config block](configuration.md). The spec accepts a preset keyword, a comma-separated list of individual group names, or a mix (e.g. `default,generation,reward`).

For the general span-group mechanism — how gating works, why a disabled group costs ~nothing — see [lens: span groups](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Lens). This page covers NeMo-RL's groups and the per-algorithm span hierarchy.

## Preset keywords

| Preset | Groups included | Relative cost |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `job`, `checkpoint`, `evaluate`, `setup`, `model_init` | Lowest — safe for production |
| `per_step` | `job`, `step`, `checkpoint`, `evaluate`, `setup`, `model_init`, `rollout`, `generation`, `logprob`, `reward`, `advantage`, `policy_update`, `data_processing`, `data_plane`, `efficiency` | Moderate |
| `all` | every group (`job` and `per_prompt` included) | Highest — dev/debug |

### `per_step` deliberately omits `per_prompt`

Every group in `per_step` emits a bounded number of spans per training step, so the preset's cost scales with steps. `per_prompt` is the exception: its spans are emitted once per prompt, so a 10k-prompt rollout produces roughly 20k spans where the phase groups produce a fixed handful. Folding it in would make `per_step` scale with dataset size instead, which is not what someone asking for step detail is asking for.

Ask for it explicitly when debugging an individual rollout:

```yaml
span_groups: per_step,per_prompt
```

or take `all`. See [Per-prompt spans](#per-prompt-spans) for what you get.

### `per_step` includes `job`, and what that costs

`job` is the whole-run root span, so enabling it alongside `step` nests **every training step under one ever-growing trace** rather than giving each step its own root. That is a real cost on a long run: the trace grows without bound and most backends get slow to render it.

It is included anyway because `job` is the only run-scoped span, and several things depend on one existing. `current_trace_carrier()` captures it to hand to the trajectory collector — with no `job` span the carrier is empty, the collector's spans re-root, and the entire async rollout path vanishes from the waterfall (see [Async rollout spans](#async-rollout-spans-come-from-the-collector-actor)). A trace that is large is more useful than a trace that is missing its rollouts.

If you want the bounded-per-step shape instead, list the groups without `job` rather than using the preset:

```yaml
span_groups: step,checkpoint,evaluate,setup,model_init,rollout,generation,logprob,reward,advantage,policy_update,data_processing,data_plane,efficiency
```

There is no subtraction syntax — `SpanRegistry.resolve` only unions presets and bare group names, so `per_step,-job` does not work.

## `RLSpanGroup`

Defined in `nemo_rl/telemetry/span_groups.py`, and declared to lens by `register_span_groups()` when that module is imported.

nemo-lens ships **no** span-group names of its own: each consuming library registers what it emits into lens's `SpanRegistry` under its own namespace (NeMo-RL's is `nemo_rl`), and `telemetry.span_groups` resolves against whatever is registered in the process. So the groups marked "base" below — the ones lens used to define — are declared by NeMo-RL too. They keep their original names, which are also the names Megatron registers for the same phases; a group two libraries both register is shared, and enabling it turns on both.

One consequence worth knowing: registration is an *import side effect*, so a group is only selectable once its module has been imported. `nemo_rl/telemetry/setup.py` imports this module before calling `setup_telemetry` for that reason.

| Group | Origin | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `job` | base | the whole-run root span (`rl.<algo>.job`) |
| `setup` | RL | startup, before the first step: `rl.startup` and the `rl.setup.*` phases under it |
| `checkpoint` | base | `rl.<algo>.checkpointing` |
| `evaluate` | base | `rl.<algo>.evaluate` |
| `model_init` | base | `rl.vllm.load_model` (generation worker), `rl.policy.load_model` / `rl.value.load_model` (training workers) |
| `step` | base | `rl.<algo>.step` (one per training step) |
| `rollout` | RL | `rl.<algo>.generation` |
| `generation` | RL | the driver-side `rl.vllm.generate` / `rl.vllm.generate_text` spans |
| `logprob` | RL | `rl.<algo>.policy_and_reference_logprobs` — the policy's and the reference model's log-probs are computed together and share this one span, so there is no separate `reference_policy` group — and `rl.distillation.teacher_logprob_inference` on the distillation path |
| `reward` | RL | `rl.<algo>.reward_calculation` |
| `advantage` | RL | `rl.<algo>.advantage_calculation` |
| `policy_update` | RL | `rl.<algo>.policy_training` (and `rl.ppo.value_training` for PPO) |
| `data_processing` | RL | `rl.<algo>.data_processing` |
| `data_plane` | RL | `rl.data_plane.<op>` — one span per transfer-queue operation from a batch-shaped caller. The eleven ops give `rl.data_plane.register`, `rl.data_plane.claim_meta`, `rl.data_plane.get_data`, `rl.data_plane.check_consumption_status`, `rl.data_plane.put`, `rl.data_plane.get`, `rl.data_plane.list_sample_ids`, `rl.data_plane.clear`, `rl.data_plane.save_checkpoint`, `rl.data_plane.load_checkpoint`, `rl.data_plane.close` |
| `per_prompt` | RL | spans emitted once per prompt: `rl.sc.generate_and_push`, the rollout path's `rl.data_plane.put`, and `rl.gym.run_rollouts` when the single controller dispatches it. A cardinality axis rather than a phase — see [Per-prompt spans](#per-prompt-spans) |
| `efficiency` | RL | idle phases on async GRPO — driver-side `rl.idle.buffer_starvation`, `rl.idle.refit_bubble`, and collector-side `rl.idle.refit_event_wait`, `rl.idle.generation_limit_pause` |

## Examples

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true

  # Coarse spans only — default
  span_groups: default

  # Per-step traces (rollout / generation / reward / advantage / policy update)
  # span_groups: per_step

  # Coarse job trace + generation spans only
  # span_groups: default,generation

  # Everything
  # span_groups: all
```

## Per-algorithm span names

Span names follow `rl.<algorithm>.<phase>`, where `<phase>` is the `Timer` key the same block records — so a span and the `timing/train/<phase>` metric measuring it carry one name rather than two, and correlating a slow span with its timing series needs no mapping. The `Timer` key is the authority: it is pre-existing and already published as a metric name, so a new span takes its name from the timer rather than the reverse.

Two spans deliberately do not follow it. `rl.<algorithm>.step` wraps `total_step_time` and `rl.<algorithm>.evaluate` wraps `total_validation_time`: a span's duration is intrinsic, so naming one after a `total_*_time` measurement is tautological, and these two are the umbrella spans a reader meets first in a waterfall. They are named after the operation instead. Every span *inside* them matches its timer key.

The controlling group is shown for each; a span is emitted whenever its group is enabled in the process that opens it.

| Algorithm | Spans |
|---|---|
| **Startup** (all algorithms) | `rl.startup` and, under it, `rl.setup.ray_init`, `rl.setup.tokenizer`, `rl.setup.data`, `rl.setup.nemo_gym_config`, `rl.setup.workers` — `setup` group; see [Startup](#startup-what-happens-before-the-first-step) |
| **GRPO** (sync + async) | `rl.grpo.job`, `rl.grpo.step`, `rl.grpo.data_processing`, `rl.grpo.generation`, `rl.grpo.reward_calculation`, `rl.grpo.policy_and_reference_logprobs`, `rl.grpo.advantage_calculation`, `rl.grpo.policy_training`, `rl.grpo.checkpointing`, `rl.grpo.evaluate` |
| **GRPO** (async only) | `rl.idle.buffer_starvation`, `rl.idle.refit_bubble` (driver) and `rl.idle.refit_event_wait`, `rl.idle.generation_limit_pause` (collector actor) — `efficiency` group; named after the `Timer` category, not the algorithm |
| **GRPO / PPO** (async only) | `rl.grpo.generation` / `rl.ppo.generation` — `rollout` group, emitted by the collector actor, one span per rollout batch; the name follows the algorithm the collector was built for |
| **PPO** | `rl.ppo.job`, `rl.ppo.step`, `rl.ppo.data_processing`, `rl.ppo.generation`, `rl.ppo.reward_calculation`, `rl.ppo.policy_and_reference_logprobs`, `rl.ppo.advantage_calculation`, `rl.ppo.policy_training`, `rl.ppo.value_training`, `rl.ppo.checkpointing`, `rl.ppo.evaluate` |
| **SFT** | `rl.sft.job`, `rl.sft.step`, `rl.sft.data_processing`, `rl.sft.policy_training`, `rl.sft.checkpointing`, `rl.sft.evaluate` |
| **SFT v2** | `rl.sft_v2.driver` wraps setup and training in the driver; `rl.sft_v2.job` and `rl.sft_v2.step` run in the controller (all unbucketed). `rl.sft_v2.read_batch` and `rl.sft_v2.prepare_batch` run on loader owners (`data_processing`); `rl.sft_v2.policy_training` runs in the controller (`policy_update`). Trace context crosses both Ray calls. |
| **DPO** | `rl.dpo.job`, `rl.dpo.step`, `rl.dpo.policy_training`, `rl.dpo.checkpointing`, `rl.dpo.evaluate` |
| **RM** | `rl.rm.job`, `rl.rm.step`, `rl.rm.checkpointing`, `rl.rm.evaluate` |
| **Distillation** | `rl.distillation.job`, `rl.distillation.step`, `rl.distillation.data_processing`, `rl.distillation.generation`, `rl.distillation.teacher_logprob_inference`, `rl.distillation.policy_training`, `rl.distillation.checkpointing`, `rl.distillation.evaluate` |
| **SingleController** | `rl.sc.job`, `rl.sc.step`, `rl.sc.logprob_inference_prep`, `rl.sc.policy_and_reference_logprobs`, `rl.sc.value_inference_prep`, `rl.sc.value_inference`, `rl.sc.advantage_calculation`, `rl.sc.training_prep`, `rl.sc.policy_training`, `rl.sc.policy_optimizer_step`, `rl.sc.value_training`, `rl.sc.checkpointing` — opened inside the `SingleControllerActor`, which is where the run actually lives |
| **SingleController** (rollout) | `rl.sc.generate_and_push` — `per_prompt` group (umbrella, so unbucketed), one span per dispatch attempt; and `idle/buffer_starvation` / `idle/refit_bubble` reusing async GRPO's `efficiency` category names. `rl.idle.buffer_starvation` is one span per *wait*, not per poll — the pump retries every 5 ms, so a span per iteration would bury a startup stall under thousands of them; it carries `rl.idle.polls` |
| **Transfer queue** | `rl.data_plane.<op>` — `data_plane` group, or `per_prompt` when the caller is a rollout; emitted wherever a data-plane client is built (SC actor, `TQPolicy` / `TQValue` workers) |
| **NeMo-Gym** | `rl.gym.run_rollouts` — one span per dispatch in the `NemoGym` actor, carrying `rl.gym.batch_size`; the HTTP calls Gym makes nest under it — see [NeMo-Gym spans](#nemo-gym-spans-cross-the-http-boundary). `rollout` group from the sync batch path, `per_prompt` from the single controller, which dispatches one per prompt. Umbrella either way, so unbucketed: these overlap |
| **vLLM** (driver-side) | `rl.vllm.generate`, `rl.vllm.generate_text` — `generation` group; nested under the active rollout span |
| **vLLM** (worker-side) | `rl.vllm.load_model` — `model_init` group; a root span in the generation worker's process, since Ray carries no trace context into `__init__` |
| **Policy / value** (worker-side) | `rl.policy.load_model`, `rl.value.load_model` — `model_init` group, `rl.backend` attribute; opened by `traced_worker_init` on the worker's `__init__`, and root spans for the same reason |

`rl.<algo>.job` is a function-level span (via `umbrella_trace_fn`) wrapping the whole run. Both shipped presets enable it, so each `rl.<algo>.step` nests under it. Drop the `job` group from an explicit group list to make every step a root trace instead.

## Span tags (categorical attributes)

These are set on spans for filtering — they answer "which one?" / "what kind?", not "how much?". Numerical values that change over time are **metrics**, not span tags (see [Metrics](metrics.md)).

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rl.iteration` | training iteration index |
| `rl.epoch` | epoch index (omitted on `rl.sc.step` — see below) |
| `rl.step` | step index |
| `rl.num_generations_per_prompt` | GRPO group size |
| `rl.weight_version` / `rl.target_weight_version` | async rollout batch: the weights it generated from, and the training step it targets |
| `rl.num_prompt_groups` | async rollout batch width, so a gap-filling batch is not read as an unexplained speed-up |
| `rl.gym.batch_size` | how many examples one `rl.gym.run_rollouts` span covers — the NeMo-Gym counterpart to `rl.num_prompt_groups` |
| `rl.idle.polls` | how many retries one `rl.idle.buffer_starvation` span covers on the single-controller path, where the span is coalesced over a poll loop. Read it against the duration: the same ten seconds is two thousand clean 5 ms polls or two hundred polls whose selection ran long, which are opposite diagnoses |
| `rl.rollout.attempt` | SingleController dispatch attempt: `0` is a first try, `> 0` a substitution after a skipped group, whose tokens were discarded |
| `rl.target_step` | the training step an `rl.sc.generate_and_push` dispatch is aimed at; omitted when the dispatch is unstamped |
| `rl.critic_epochs` | critic epochs covered by one `rl.sc.value_training` span |
| `rl.ppo_epoch` | PPO epoch index on `rl.sc.policy_training` |
| `rl.data_plane.op` | which transfer-queue operation an `rl.data_plane.<op>` span covers — the same value as the span-name suffix, so you can group on it without parsing names |
| `rl.data_plane.partition` | the partition the operation targets |
| `rl.data_plane.keys` / `rl.data_plane.bytes` | key count and payload size for that one operation. Set after the inner client returns, since neither is known at span open |
| `rl.data_plane.status` | `ok` / `error` / `timeout` — distinguishes a timeout from a generic failure, which the recorded exception alone does not |
| `rl.bucket` | goodput bucket: `productive` / `overhead` / `idle` / `wasted` (omit on umbrellas) |

`rl.sc.step` carries `rl.iteration` and `rl.weight_version` but no `rl.epoch`.
In the SingleController the rollout pump advances the epoch on its own clock, so
the epoch counter at the time a train step runs describes how far *generation*
has read into the dataset — not the epoch this step's batch came from. Use the
rollout-side spans for that.

### Span group → `rl.bucket`

Leaf groups are tagged automatically when using
`nemo_rl.telemetry.instrumentation.managed_span` / `trace_fn`. Umbrellas are
timed but **not** tagged so monitors can exclude them from goodput, and they are
opened through `umbrella_span` / `umbrella_trace_fn` with the group's `U_` alias
so the call site shows which of the two it is — see
[Extending](extending.md#umbrella-spans-say-so-at-the-call-site).

| Group | `rl.bucket` |
|---|---|
| `job`, `step`, `rollout`, `model_init`, `evaluate`, `setup`, `per_prompt` (aliased `U_JOB`, `U_STEP`, …) | *(none — umbrella)* |
| `generation`, `reward`, `policy_update` | `productive` |
| `data_processing`, `data_plane`, `checkpoint`, `logprob`, `advantage` | `overhead` |
| `efficiency` | `idle` for the two driver-side phases; *none* for the two collector-side ones (see below) |

Rolled-up `rl.goodput` is **monitor-derived**, not emitted by NeMo-RL.

#### Overriding the bucket for a region: `bucket_scope`

The table above classifies by *what ran*, but a few phases are productive or not
depending on *why* they ran. `bucket_scope(bucket)` reclassifies every leaf span
opened inside it:

```python
with bucket_scope(Bucket.OVERHEAD):
    ...  # generation in here is tagged overhead, not productive
```

The one production use is validation, in `grpo.validate` and `ppo.validate`.
Validation generates through the same `generation` group as a training rollout,
but its tokens are scored and discarded, so `productive` would count a
validation pass as goodput. The span is opened by a decorator on
`VllmGeneration.generate` that cannot see its caller, which is why the scope
travels with the execution context (a `ContextVar`) rather than an argument.

Three properties keep it from creating the double-counting problem it exists to
avoid: umbrellas stay unbucketed inside a scope, an explicit `rl.bucket=` passed
to `managed_span` still wins, and an `efficiency_span` keeps its category's
bucket — that one names the phase it measures, so a caller cannot make
`idle/refit_bubble` productive. It propagates into coroutines started
inside the block — `asyncio.run`, as the rollout entrypoints use — but not into
threads or Ray actors, so a worker-side span is unaffected.

### The `efficiency` group: idle time on async runs

Async GRPO measures its stalls with `Timer` under labels like
`idle/buffer_starvation`, on both sides of the run: the driver waiting on the
collector, and the collector waiting on the driver. `efficiency_span` in
`nemo_rl/telemetry/instrumentation.py` emits those as spans, taking the bucket
from `EFFICIENCY_CATEGORY_BUCKET` so `idle/*` lands in `idle` rather than
defaulting to `overhead`. Each span also carries
`rl.efficiency.category` with the raw label, so idle time can be grouped by
cause without parsing the span name.

Two driver-side phases are wired today, both children of `rl.grpo.step`:

| Span | Category | Bucket | What the driver is waiting on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rl.idle.buffer_starvation` | `idle/buffer_starvation` | `idle` | replay buffer is empty — the collector is not keeping up |
| `rl.idle.refit_bubble` | `idle/refit_bubble` | `idle` | collector reaching a safe point, then weight sync |

With these enabled, a step's child spans account for much more of the step
duration, so a per-step goodput breakdown leaves a smaller unattributed gap.

A wait implemented as a poll loop needs the other emitter,
`start_efficiency_span`. `efficiency_span` is a context manager, so bracketing
the sleep gives one span per iteration — on the single-controller pump, whose
poll is 5 ms, a startup stall becomes thousands of identical spans. The
hand-managed form opens the span on the first starved poll and ends it when the
wait breaks, reporting the retry count as `rl.idle.polls`. It deliberately does
not make the span current: held open across `await` points, a current span is
copied into every task created during the wait, which would reparent unrelated
rollout work under an idle span.

Coalescing does mean the span covers the loop's own selection work, not just the
sleeps. That is only sound because a *starved* poll never reaches the data
plane — `evict()` returns early when nothing is stale, and `select()` gives up
before claiming anything — so the span still has no bucketed children to be
double-counted against. A wait whose retries do instrumented work cannot be
coalesced this way.

#### Why `idle/validation` is not a span

`idle/validation` is driver-side wall-clock like the two above, but it stays
`Timer`-only, because the window it measures is already accounted as
**`overhead`**: `validate()` wraps its generation in `bucket_scope`, so a second
span calling the same interval `idle` would contradict the label and, wherever
those generate spans exist, be counted twice — a rollup sums durations by
`rl.bucket` with no notion of nesting, so the pass would read as nearly double
its wall time.

Whether the children exist depends on the rollout path: sync validation
generates through the traced `rl.vllm.generate`, while async validation goes
through `generate_async`, which carries no span today. The `overhead`
attribution is the same either way, which is why this is `Timer`-only in both.

This is the general rule for `efficiency_span`: **wrap a wait, not a phase that
does instrumented work.** A bucketed span must be a leaf, which is the same
invariant the umbrella groups exist to preserve.

One gap remains: the phase means different things per fleet. The training GPUs
are idle while the generation GPUs do necessary non-training work, and
`overhead` on the generate span describes the latter only. Attributing the
former needs per-fleet accounting, not a per-phase bucket. Note also that the
`val_at_start` pass has no efficiency timer, so it appears in spans (as
`overhead` generation) but not in `efficiency/*`.

#### Trace-only: the collector's two loop waits

`idle/refit_event_wait` and `idle/generation_limit_pause` are emitted as spans
from inside the `AsyncTrajectoryCollector`, but **without** `rl.bucket`:

| Span | Category | Bucket | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rl.idle.refit_event_wait` | `idle/refit_event_wait` | *none* | collection loop parked while a refit completes |
| `rl.idle.generation_limit_pause` | `idle/generation_limit_pause` | *none* | every target weight already has enough trajectories |

Both are `Event.wait()` calls on the single collection-loop thread, so they are
honest wall-clock durations — but the collector's wall clock runs *concurrently*
with the driver's, so summing them against a driver-side denominator would
overcount. Omitting the attribute keeps them out of a bucket rollup by
construction instead of by convention. The membership list is
`COLLECTOR_LOOP_CATEGORIES` in `nemo_rl/telemetry/instrumentation.py`, which
`UNBUCKETED_SPAN_CATEGORIES` extends with `init/total`.

They still carry `rl.efficiency.category`, so they remain identifiable in a
trace and continue to be reported as `efficiency/*` scalars. As metrics they are
labelled `rl.efficiency.measurement="collector_wall_clock"` — sequential and so
real durations, unlike the batch-worker categories, but on the collector's
timeline rather than the driver's. See
[Metrics — always filter on `rl.efficiency.measurement`](metrics.md#always-filter-on-rlefficiencymeasurement).

#### Still reserved: the rest of the collector-side categories

`idle/buffer_full_backoff` and `wasted/failed_trajectory` stay `Timer`-only.
Both run in the batch-worker threads, so they are genuinely *thread-seconds* —
several workers accumulate at once and the total can exceed the wall time it
happened in. `idle/buffer_full_backoff` also has no clean block to wrap: it is
recorded as a precomputed duration spanning a retry loop. `wasted/failed_trajectory`
covers the same window as the enclosing `rl.grpo.generation` span, so a span
there would duplicate an existing interval.

So goodput on async runs covers driver idle, but not collector-side idle or
wasted work — use the `efficiency/*` metrics for those.

## Startup: what happens before the first step

The `setup` group covers everything between process start and the first training
step. It is in **both** shipped presets: startup is a fixed handful of spans
emitted once per run, so it costs nothing at steady state, and "why was the first
step so late" is a question a coarse preset needs to answer. `model_init` is in
both presets for the same reason and travels with it — without it the worker
build shows as one opaque block with `rl.vllm.load_model`, usually its largest
part, missing from inside.

```
rl.startup                                    (launcher)
├── rl.setup.ray_init                          rl.ray.cluster_source=started_local
├── rl.setup.tokenizer
├── rl.setup.data                              (run_grpo.py)
├── rl.setup.nemo_gym_config                   (single controller, if gym is on)
└── rl.setup.workers
    ├── rl.vllm.load_model                    (generation worker, separate trace)
    ├── rl.policy.load_model                  (training worker,   separate trace)
    └── rl.value.load_model                   (PPO critic,        separate trace)
```

The three worker-side loads carry `rl.backend` — `megatron`, `dtensor` or
`dtensor_v2` for the trainer, so one query compares the same phase across
backends — and each is emitted once per worker process, so a slow rank shows up
as one long span among its peers rather than an average.

`rl.startup` exists because `init_ray()` and the algorithm's `setup()` are
separate top-level calls in the launcher; without a span across them their
phases arrive as unrelated root traces. It closes before training begins, so
the `job` span and everything nested under it form a trace of their own rather
than joining startup's.

`rl.setup.ray_init` is emitted by `init_ray()` itself, so every launcher gets it
without opting in. It carries `rl.ray.cluster_source`:
`attached_external` (a cluster ray.sub or KubeRay already had running),
`reused_local` (one an earlier NeMo-RL run left behind), or `started_local` (paid
to boot a new one). Attaching and booting differ by tens of seconds, which is the
usual reason two otherwise identical runs disagree on time-to-first-step.

### No bucket on any startup span

Unlike the other leaf groups, `setup` spans carry no `rl.bucket` at all. The
phases nest (`rl.startup` over `rl.setup.workers` over `rl.vllm.load_model`) and
the worker builds run *concurrently* under parallel init, so a rollup adding
them by bucket would multiply startup rather than measure it. The flat number
lives in the `rl.setup.duration` metric at `phase=total_setup` — see
[Metrics — startup phases](metrics.md#startup-phases). These spans are for shape.

### The initial buffer fill

On async GRPO the driver blocks before its first step until the replay buffer
holds a full batch. That wait is `rl.init.total` (category `init/total`), a child
of no step — it happens before the loop.

It carries **no** `rl.bucket`, for the same reason as the collector's loop waits:
the generation fleet is busy for that entire window and its
`rl.grpo.generation` spans join the same trace, so bucketing the wait would
charge one stretch of wall clock to two buckets. The `init/total` *metric* keeps
its `overhead` bucket, because it is read as a single per-run number rather than
summed beside sibling spans. The membership list for this rule is
`UNBUCKETED_SPAN_CATEGORIES` in `nemo_rl/telemetry/instrumentation.py`.

Async PPO records the same `init/total` timer but emits no span for it yet.

### Async rollout spans come from the collector actor

In an async run, no rollout is generated on the driver. Every trajectory comes
from inside `AsyncTrajectoryCollector`, a separate Ray actor, which calls
`init_telemetry_worker(rank=0, world_size=1)` in its constructor. Explicit rank
because it is a singleton, not a member of a ranked group, and its `runtime_env`
is a copy of the driver's environment — so without this its spans would carry
whatever `RANK` the driver happened to have. The driver reports itself the same
way, for the same reason.

It flushes through `flush_telemetry()`, which the driver calls before `ray.kill`,
since a kill runs no `atexit` handler. That call stops the collection loop and
waits (bounded) for in-flight batch workers first: the shutdown is terminal, so
a still-running thread would keep opening spans against a dead processor.

Each batch worker opens one `rl.grpo.generation` span — the same name the sync
path uses on the driver, so the two modes read alike — carrying
`rl.weight_version`, `rl.target_weight_version`, `rl.num_generations_per_prompt`
and `rl.num_prompt_groups`. The last one is the batch width: a gap-filling batch
covers a fraction of a full one, so without it a short span looks like an
unexplained speed-up. It is in the `rollout` group, so it is an
umbrella and carries **no** `rl.bucket`: several batch workers run at once, so
their durations sum past wall time and cannot enter a bucket rollup.

`rl.sc.generate_and_push` is an umbrella for the same reason, though it sits in
`per_prompt` rather than `rollout` (see [Per-prompt spans](#per-prompt-spans)).
The SingleController dispatches one asyncio task per prompt group, bounded by
`async_rl.max_inflight_prompts` — `num_prompts_per_step` in most recipes and
`1280` in one — so that many spans can be open at once. Tagged `productive` they
would sum to a large multiple of the wall clock they happened in. On the sync path the
productive generation term comes from the `rl.vllm.generate` spans on the
`generate()` call instead; the async single-controller path has no generation
span yet.

It also carries `rl.rollout.attempt`, because the span is opened inside the
dispatch retry loop: a skipped group is substituted in place and the loop opens
another span. `attempt > 0` is generation whose tokens were discarded — the same
thing async GRPO reports as `wasted/failed_trajectory`.

#### Getting the collector into one waterfall

Ray does not propagate OTel context, so an actor's spans start their own trace
by default. The driver captures its active span as a W3C `traceparent` carrier
with `current_trace_carrier()` — taken inside `rl.grpo.job`, at the point the
collector is constructed — and passes it as the actor's `trace_carrier`
argument. The collector reopens it with `remote_trace_context()` in **both** the
collection-loop thread and every batch-worker thread. Per thread, not once per
process: OTel context is a `ContextVar`, and `threading.Thread` inherits none.

The result is a single trace per run:

```
rl.grpo.job                                   (driver)
├── rl.grpo.step  (iteration 1)               (driver)
│   ├── rl.idle.buffer_starvation
│   └── rl.grpo.policy_training
├── rl.grpo.generation  weight=7              (collector, thread A)
├── rl.idle.generation_limit_pause            (collector, loop thread)
├── rl.grpo.generation  weight=8              (collector, thread B)
└── rl.grpo.step  (iteration 2)               (driver)
```

**This requires the `job` group to be enabled.** `current_trace_carrier()`
returns an empty dict when no span is recording, and `remote_trace_context({})`
is a no-op, so the collector falls back to root spans. `per_step` and `all`
both enable `job` alongside `rollout`/`efficiency`, so the unified view is what
you get by default:

```yaml
telemetry:
  span_groups: per_step   # or: all
```

`default` is the exception: it has `job` but neither `rollout` nor
`efficiency`, so the collector emits nothing at all and there is no rollout
detail to attach.

Note the cost this buys. A run-long root span means one trace accumulating
every step and every rollout batch for the whole job. That is the deliberate
trade described in [`per_step` includes `job`](#per_step-includes-job-and-what-that-costs) —
on a very long run, prefer an explicit group list without `job` and accept
per-step root traces.

Two consequences worth internalizing before reading an async trace:

- **One span per batch, not per sample.** `generate_async` is dispatched one
  coroutine per sample, so spanning it would emit thousands of mutually
  overlapping spans per step.
- **There is no `productive` generation span in async mode**, and there cannot
  usefully be one. `rl.vllm.generate` is only reached through the synchronous
  rollout path, and an async run never takes it: `async_grpo_train` requires an
  async generation engine, so even validation goes through `generate_async`,
  which carries no span today. Generation is a
  continuously-batched pipeline overlapping training, so its productive
  contribution is a utilization question — answered by fleet metrics — not a
  span duration. A span-derived goodput ratio on an async run therefore has no
  productive generation term; do not read it as "generation contributed
  nothing."

### NeMo-Gym spans cross the HTTP boundary

A Gym rollout leaves the driver over two hops, and each needs its own
mechanism:

```
driver / collector              NemoGym actor                 Gym server
────────────────────            ─────────────                 ──────────
rl.grpo.generation
  └─ run_rollouts.remote() ───▶ rl.gym.run_rollouts
        Ray hop:                  └─ aiohttp POST ──────────▶ FastAPI
        carrier kwarg                  HTTP hop:                 server spans
                                       traceparent header
```

The Ray hop uses the carrier kwarg described above:
`dispatch_with_trace_context` injects it at the call site and
`@accepts_trace_context` on `NemoGym.run_rollouts` reopens it in the actor.

The HTTP hop needs no NeMo-RL code at the call site, because the request is
made inside Gym's own client rather than by NeMo-RL. The `NemoGym` actor calls
`instrument_aiohttp_client()` in its constructor, which patches the aiohttp
client class so every outgoing request carries a `traceparent` taken from the
ambient context. That is why the Ray hop has to work first: with no context
attached in the actor, the header carries nothing useful.

The HTTP hop is gated on the `per_prompt` group, so it is off under both
`default` and `per_step`, and on under `all` or an explicit
`per_step,per_prompt`. The instrumentor spans every request off the global
tracer without consulting the enabled-group set, so whatever turns it on pays a
span per HTTP call for the rest of the run — prompts × turns × tool calls,
which is a higher volume than the ~2-per-prompt spans `per_prompt` already
exists to fence off. Gating it on `rollout` instead would put that volume in
`per_step`, whose contract is that its cost scales with steps rather than
dataset size. The group has to describe the volume, not the phase, even though
these spans sit inside the rollout.

Completing the trace on the server side is a change in the Gym repository, not
this one — its app has to call `nemo.lens.contrib.fastapi.instrument_fastapi`.
Until it does, the header arrives and is ignored, and Gym's internal spans (if
any) stay in their own traces. Everything up to and including the client-side
HTTP span still nests correctly.

Two failure modes degrade quietly rather than breaking a rollout. Without
`nemo-lens[aiohttp]` installed the constructor logs a warning once and Gym's
HTTP calls start their own traces; with telemetry disabled entirely both calls
are no-ops.

## Per-prompt spans

Two spans on the SingleController path are emitted once per prompt rather than
once per step or per batch:

| Span | Emitted | Bucket |
|---|---|---|
| `rl.sc.generate_and_push` | one per dispatch attempt, in the SC actor | none (umbrella) |
| `rl.data_plane.put` | one per group commit, nested inside the above | none (umbrella) |

They share the `per_prompt` group, which is a **cardinality axis** rather than a
phase — the one group in `RLSpanGroup` that does not name a stage of work. What
governs whether you want these is not that one is a rollout span and the other a
transfer-queue span; it is that their count scales with the prompt count. A
10k-prompt rollout emits roughly 20k of them, against a fixed handful per step
from every phase group. That is why they are reachable only from `all` or an
explicit `per_step,per_prompt`.

If 20k per rollout is more than you want, the only lever is `per_prompt` itself
— the two go together. Dropping `data_plane` does not thin them out: inside a
rollout the put is gated on `per_prompt` rather than `data_plane` (see below),
so `data_plane` governs only the batch-shaped data-plane spans. With
`per_prompt` off, transfer-queue time inside a rollout still shows up as a gap
between the `rl.sc.*` phase spans.

### Why the group has to come from the caller

`rl.data_plane.put` is emitted by `MetricsDataPlaneClient`, and there is **one
client per process**, shared by callers with wildly different cardinality:

```
SC actor process, one client from build_data_plane_client()
  ├─ RolloutManager → TQReplayBuffer.commit → put_samples()   once per prompt
  └─ _advantage_stage(meta)                → put_samples()    once per batch
```

Same op, same client, counts orders of magnitude apart. So neither the op name
nor a constructor argument can distinguish them, and the client cannot see its
caller. The rollout path therefore marks its region with
`instrumentation.per_prompt_scope()`, a `ContextVar` the client consults — the
same mechanism [`bucket_scope`](#overriding-the-bucket-for-a-region-bucket_scope)
uses for the same reason. Entering the scope also means the put is gated *with*
the rollout span: turn `per_prompt` off and both disappear.

A rollout's put is unbucketed where a batch stage's put is `overhead`. That is
deliberate: rollouts overlap each other and training, so summing their durations
into `overhead` would push that bucket past the wall clock it happened in, by up
to `max_inflight_prompts`. The scope propagates to nested calls and to
coroutines started inside it, but not to raw threads — a data-plane call handed
to a thread pool would read as batch-shaped.

## Coverage gaps

A group being enabled does not guarantee spans: something has to emit them. Known
blanks today, so an empty trace is not read as a broken exporter:

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| SGLang / TRT-LLM / Megatron generation workers | uninstrumented — no `init_telemetry_worker` and no generation spans; only vLLM emits `rl.vllm.*`. (Policy and value workers do initialise telemetry, so their metrics and any future spans are wired.) |
| `VllmGeneration.generate_async` | no span, so async rollouts and async validation have no generate breakdown under `rl.grpo.generation` / `rl.grpo.evaluate` |
| `SyncRolloutActor` | the sync data-plane counterpart of the async collector — uninstrumented, so its rollouts produce no spans |
| Worker flush outside async GRPO | only `async_grpo_train` calls `policy.shutdown()` / `policy_generation.shutdown()`, so on other trainers a worker's last spans depend on the periodic export rather than a flush |
| `grpo_sync.py` | no spans |
| Startup phases inside `setup()` | `rl.setup.workers` is one block; its sub-phases run concurrently in worker threads, which OTel context does not reach, so they would detach into their own traces. Read the `rl.setup.duration` metric for the breakdown |
| `rl.startup` in other launchers | `run_grpo.py`, `run_grpo_single_controller.py`, and `run_sft_v2.py` open the umbrella; other launchers leave `rl.setup.ray_init` as a root span rather than part of a startup waterfall |
| `rl.init.total` on async PPO | the timer is recorded, but `async_ppo_train` is otherwise uninstrumented, so the span is not emitted there |
| SingleController generation workers | the actor's own phases are instrumented and the `TQPolicy` / `TQValue` presharded entrypoints are parented, but the generation workers get no trace context, so their spans are separate traces correlated by `nemo.run.id` |
| SingleController token-capture dispatch | with `token_capture` finalizers configured, `_dispatch_one_prompt` generates through `generate_for_finalization` and commits via the finalizer actor pool, and that branch opens no `rl.sc.generate_and_push` span — so per-prompt dispatch is unattributed on token-capture runs. The `per_prompt` scope is likewise not entered there, so the commit's data-plane spans stay batch-shaped |
| `run_vlm_grpo.py`, `run_grpo_sliding_puzzle.py`, `run_xtoken_off_policy_distillation.py`, `run_eval.py` | these call the instrumented loops but never `init_telemetry_driver`, so a `telemetry:` block in their configs parses, the run succeeds, and nothing is emitted — driver or worker |
| Non-presharded worker calls | the presharded data-plane entrypoints are parented, but `lm_policy` / `lm_value`'s own `train` / `get_logprobs` / `get_values` and every vLLM worker method are dispatched without a carrier, so those spans stay separate traces correlated by `nemo.run.id` |
| Worker `__init__` spans | `rl.*.load_model` is opened before any call carries context, so the load spans are roots no matter what the caller does |

## Resource attributes (process tags)

Stable-for-the-run values, set once at init and attached to every span/metric: `nv.dl.campaign.stage` (always `RL`), `rl.algorithm`, `rl.model`, `nemo.precision`, `dl.tensor_parallel.size`, `dl.pipeline_parallel.size`, plus `nv.dl.rank` / `nv.dl.world_size`. See [Configuration — Resource attributes](configuration.md#resource-attributes).

## Granularity guidance

| Span groups | Relative cost | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Disabled (`telemetry.enabled: false`) | None | The default |
| `default` | Lowest | Safe for all production runs |
| `per_step` | Moderate | Per-step profiling; one trace for the whole run |
| `all` | Highest | Development / deep debugging |

A process with telemetry disabled has an empty span-group set — `is_span_group_enabled()` returns `False` everywhere, so no span objects are created at all. The disabled path is a `frozenset` lookup and an immediate return. See [lens: architecture](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Lens).
