# Metrics

NeMo-RL emits five namespaces of metrics: async efficiency metrics (`rl.efficiency.*`), startup phase durations (`rl.setup.duration`), training scalars (`rl.reward.*`, `rl.policy.*`, …), vLLM engine metrics (`rl.vllm.*`), and driver-side vLLM generation metrics (`gen_ai.*`, following the OTel GenAI semantic conventions).

Metrics are emitted **only when telemetry is exporting** — the driver always exports, so the `rl.*` series come from the driver's metrics logger.

Every `rl.*` series is **declared by NeMo-RL**, not by lens. lens provides a consumer-driven metric registry: NeMo-RL calls `register_metric_group("rl", [...])` once per process with a `MetricSpec` per series, then records against it with `record_metrics(meter, "rl", ...)`. The declarations live in one table in `nemo_rl/telemetry/metrics.py`, so adding a series needs no lens release and no agreement on field names. `record_metrics` never raises into the caller and skips `None`.

## The tee

The tee lives outside the algorithm code: `nemo_rl/telemetry/metrics.py` hooks `nemo_rl.utils.logger.Logger.log_metrics`, so after `log_metrics` fans a step out to the file / W&B / MLflow backends it calls `tee_rl_metrics_to_otel(metrics, prefix)`. It is best-effort — two prefixes are read, the driver's per-step `train` dicts (`prefix in ("train", "")`) and the one-off `timing/setup` dict at step 0, so other prefixes are skipped, non-scalar values are ignored, and the whole path is a no-op unless telemetry is actively exporting. The numbers you already see in W&B are therefore the same series you get in your OTLP backend, with no double bookkeeping.

Each family has its own exception handler, so a bad value in one cannot silence the others.

## Training scalars

Mirrored from the keys the algorithms already log, one row per series in `_TRAIN_SCALARS`:

| Metric | Type | Logger key |
|---|---|---|
| `rl.reward.mean` | Gauge | `reward` |
| `rl.kl.divergence` | Gauge | `kl_penalty` |
| `rl.policy.loss` | Gauge | `loss` |
| `rl.value.loss` | Gauge | `critic/loss` (PPO) |
| `rl.entropy` | Gauge | `approx_entropy` |
| `rl.response.length.mean` | Gauge (`{token}`) | `mean_gen_tokens_per_sample` |
| `rl.grad_norm` | Gauge | `grad_norm` |
| `rl.learning_rate` | Gauge | `lr` |

SFT v2 logs from its controller actor, which initializes telemetry before its
first metric is logged. The controller's fixed step measurements are also teed:

| Metric | Type | Logger key |
|---|---|---|
| `rl.sft_v2.loader.latency.max` | Gauge (`s`) | `loader_latency_max` |
| `rl.sft_v2.policy.duration` | Gauge (`s`) | `policy_time` |
| `rl.sft_v2.step.duration` | Gauge (`s`) | `total_step_time` |
| `rl.sft_v2.valid_tokens_per_second` | Gauge (`{token}/s`) | `valid_tokens_per_second` |

`kl_penalty` is named for the penalty but holds the divergence — the coefficient is divided back out in `loss_functions.py` — which is why the metric is named `rl.kl.divergence`.

Each row is declared in the module that logs its key, using the same constant the logging site uses, so a rename cannot leave a gauge silently reporting nothing.

## Startup phases

Every algorithm's `setup()` already timed its startup phases and logged them under the `timing/setup` prefix at step 0 (`SetupTimingMetrics` in `nemo_rl/algorithms/metric_utils.py`). Those are teed as one dimensioned gauge:

| Metric | Type | Attributes | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rl.setup.duration` | Gauge (`s`) | `rl.setup.phase` | Wall clock spent in one startup phase |

Dimensioned rather than one series per phase because the phase set is not knowable at declaration time: alongside its declared fields `SetupTimingMetrics` carries a free-form `extras` dict, and the sparse-refit transports add `vllm_<transport>_sparse_init_time_s` to it at runtime. A row per phase would silently drop whatever it had not been taught about.

The phase name is the logger key with its `_time_s` / `_s` suffix stripped, so `generation_init_time_s` becomes `phase=generation_init`. Requiring one of those suffixes is also the filter that keeps non-durations out — `parallel_init_enabled` is a flag, not a phase.

Representative phases: `generation_init` (and its `generation_init_reserve` / `generation_init_load` parts), `policy_init`, `value_init`, `nemo_gym_init`, `collective_init`, `weight_sync`, `teacher_model_init`, `parallel_wall`, `worker_setup`, `other_setup`, `total_setup`.

### `rl.setup.duration` carries no `rl.bucket`

Unlike `rl.efficiency.seconds`, these phases overlap each other by construction: `total_setup` contains the rest, `parallel_wall` covers the generation and policy builds running concurrently, and `generation_init_reserve` / `generation_init_load` are parts of `generation_init`. Anything summing them by bucket would count startup several times over.

Read one phase at a time. For "what did startup cost", use `phase=total_setup` — that is the one value that cannot double-count. The `rl.setup.*` spans give the same phases their shape in a trace; see [Span groups — Startup](span-groups.md#startup-what-happens-before-the-first-step).

## W&B history step axes

W&B's internal `_step` is a monotonically increasing history-row number, not a
NeMo-RL trainer step. Trainer-correlated metrics are buffered into one history
row and carry the explicit `nemo_rl/step` field. Use `nemo_rl/step` when plotting
or joining training metrics by optimizer step; relying on `_step` also counts
independently committed telemetry rows and can misalign the series.

Independent event streams use their own custom axes and do not carry
`nemo_rl/step`. In particular, Single-Controller rollout benchmark series under
`rollout/throughput/*`, `timing/rollout_checkpoint/*`,
`timing/rollout_recovery/*`, and `rollout/checkpoint_outcome/*` use
`telemetry/wall_time_seconds`, recorded as Unix wall-clock time. This lets those
series continue through a long or paused trainer step and across process restart
without changing the meaning of the trainer-step axis.

## Single-Controller rollout recovery metrics

Wall-clock rollout telemetry sampling is disabled by default. Enable it without
changing the checkpoint cadence by setting, for example:

```yaml
rollout_checkpointing:
  telemetry_interval_s: 30.0
```

This records one throughput and controller-pressure sample every 30 seconds.
Set the value back to `null` to disable the sampler. Detailed per-interval
metric dictionaries are printed to the controller log only when
`async_rl.diagnostics: true`; configured metric backends receive them either
way.

The rollout checkpoint benchmark focuses on the following questions:

1. Did checkpointing reduce raw generation or usable rollout throughput?
2. Which save or restore phase took the time?
3. How much live data-plane work waited behind the checkpoint barrier?
4. Did scheduled checkpoint attempts succeed at the intended cadence?
5. How much completed rollout work was reused after restart?

| Prefix | Important fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rollout/throughput` | `generation_output_tokens_per_second`, `committed_output_tokens_per_second`, `committed_groups_per_second` | Raw backend decoding throughput compared with output committed for training. The raw metric is absent when the backend does not expose compatible cumulative counters. With token capture, committed tokens are counted exactly from valid staged rows; without token capture, they are estimated by multiplying the reported per-sample mean by the number of completions, so compare like-for-like runs. |
| `rollout/throughput` | `checkpoint_blocked_mutations`, `checkpoint_mutation_wait_seconds_p95`, `checkpoint_mutation_wait_seconds_max` | Number and latency of live data-plane mutations delayed by an exclusive checkpoint. |
| `timing/rollout_checkpoint` | `total_save_seconds`, `tq_save_seconds`, `barrier_wait_seconds`, `exclusive_hold_seconds`, `sidecar_save_seconds`, `snapshot_commit_seconds` | End-to-end save latency and its storage, fencing, controller-sidecar, and atomic-publication components. |
| `timing/rollout_checkpoint` | `snapshot_rows`, `replay_rows`, `staging_rows`, `replay_groups`, `ledger_groups`, `controller_sidecar_bytes` | Logical volume captured by the snapshot. `controller_sidecar_bytes` excludes the native TQ payload because the current TQ checkpoint API does not report bytes written. NeMo-RL deliberately does not recursively scan the shared checkpoint directory because that scan would perturb the benchmark. |
| `rollout/checkpoint_outcome` | `completed`, `skipped`, `failed`, `reason_*`, `seconds_since_previous_success`, `seconds_since_last_success` | Result, actionable reason, and effective cadence of every scheduled checkpoint attempt. |
| `timing/rollout_recovery` | `snapshot_resolution_seconds`, `dataloader_load_seconds`, `tq_load_seconds`, `replay_metadata_load_seconds`, `recovery_prepare_seconds`, `total_load_seconds` | Rollout-state restore latency. `total_load_seconds` is the sum of these non-overlapping restore phases. |
| `timing/rollout_recovery` | `groups_complete_restored`, `groups_unfinished_found`, `siblings_reused`, `siblings_rerun`, `redispatch_schedule_seconds` | Training-ready groups restored without generation, unfinished groups found for redispatch, and sibling work preserved or rerun after restart. |

Recovery counters describe work reconstructed at restore time, not a promise
that every restored group will eventually train. After recovery, the configured
sampler may still evict a restored group under its normal staleness rules (for
example, when a `windowed` sampler finds that the group's policy version has
fallen outside its valid window).

`barrier_wait_seconds` and mutation wait latency measure opposite sides of the
same fence. The former is how long the checkpoint waits for already-running
mutations; the latter is how long rollout or training mutations wait for the
checkpoint to release its exclusive cut.

The vLLM request, KV-cache, controller-waiter, buffer-occupancy, and per-mutation
kind fields are diagnostic drill-down signals. They are useful when one of the
primary throughput or barrier metrics regresses, but do not need to appear on
the primary rollout checkpoint dashboard.

## Async efficiency metrics (`rl.efficiency.*`)

Async GRPO measures where wall time goes with a `Timer` and logs the result as `efficiency/*` scalars (`print_efficiency_summary` in `nemo_rl/algorithms/utils.py`). Those same values are teed to OTel as one **dimensioned** gauge rather than one instrument per category, so adding a category needs no instrument change.

| Metric | Type | Attributes | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rl.efficiency.seconds` | Gauge (`s`) | `rl.efficiency.category`, `rl.efficiency.measurement`, `rl.efficiency.window`, `rl.bucket` | Time attributed to one efficiency category |
| `rl.efficiency.pct` | Gauge (`%`) | `rl.efficiency.measurement`, `rl.efficiency.window` | Productive share of driver-side wall clock over the window named by `rl.efficiency.window` |

The single-controller path reuses two of these category names — `idle/buffer_starvation` for the wait when the training fleet is stalled on the buffer, and `idle/refit_bubble` for `weight_sync` — so a goodput rollup reads the same vocabulary on both paths. Both are spans only there; the single controller logs no `efficiency/*` scalars of its own.

### Always filter on `rl.efficiency.measurement`

Some categories are measured on the driver against wall time; others are summed across concurrent collector threads and **can exceed the wall time they happened in**.

| `rl.efficiency.measurement` | Recorded on | Categories | Safe to sum against elapsed driver time? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wall_clock` | driver, sequentially | `init/total`, `idle/buffer_starvation`, `idle/refit_bubble`, `idle/validation` | yes |
| `collector_wall_clock` | collector's collection-loop thread, sequentially | `idle/refit_event_wait`, `idle/generation_limit_pause` | no — real durations, but on a timeline that runs concurrently with the driver's |
| `thread_seconds` | collector's batch-worker threads, concurrently | `idle/buffer_full_backoff`, `wasted/failed_trajectory` | no — not durations at all |

Eight rollout threads each backing off for 10s during the same 10s window produce a `thread_seconds` value of 80, not 10. Summing `rl.efficiency.seconds` by `rl.bucket` without filtering therefore overstates idle time — a wrong answer that looks like a real one. Filter to `rl.efficiency.measurement="wall_clock"` before comparing against elapsed time; read the other two per-phase, `thread_seconds` as a saturation signal.

The non-`wall_clock` values also carry `rl.bucket` so all three share one vocabulary with the spans; the `measurement` attribute is what keeps a bucket rollup honest.

Two deliberate metric/span disagreements to know about before comparing a metric rollup against a trace rollup:

- **The two collector-loop categories** carry `rl.bucket="idle"` as metrics and rely on you filtering by `measurement`, but carry no bucket at all as spans, since a trace has no equivalent filter to rely on.
- **`idle/validation`** is `idle` as a metric and `overhead` on every span covering the same seconds. Both are true of different fleets: the training GPUs are idle, which is what the driver's timer measures, while the generation GPUs are doing necessary non-training work, which is what `bucket_scope(Bucket.OVERHEAD)` in `validate()` tags. Attributing this phase properly needs per-fleet accounting; until then, do not expect the two rollups to agree on a validation step. See [span groups — why `idle/validation` is not a span](span-groups.md#why-idlevalidation-is-not-a-span).

### `rl.efficiency.window`: what a value covers in time

`measurement` says whether values may be summed *against each other*; `window` says whether one may be summed *across steps*. They are independent, and the second is the easier one to get silently wrong.

| `rl.efficiency.window` | Categories | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `step` | `idle/buffer_starvation`, `idle/refit_bubble`, `idle/validation` | per-step delta — the driver resets its `Timer` every step, so these sum across steps |
| `run` | `init/total`, all four collector-side categories, and `rl.efficiency.pct` on the async PPO path | cumulative since the process started — consecutive points already contain each other, so summing across steps multiplies by the step count |

`init/total` is the driver-side exception: it is measured once, waiting for the first buffer fill before the step loop, then republished unchanged every step so it does not disappear from a dashboard after step 1. Read it as a constant. The collector's `Timer` is never reset, which is why everything from it is `run`.

**`rl.efficiency.pct` carries whichever window its denominator had — read the attribute, do not assume.** `print_efficiency_summary` tags it `window="step"` when the caller passed a per-step wall time and `window="run"` when it fell back to the run's elapsed time. Async GRPO passes the per-step value; async PPO does not, so its points are `run`. The per-step form is the one to trust: its numerator is the three `step`-window idle categories over that step's wall time. `init/total` is deliberately excluded — it is a run constant, so folding it in would charge the whole startup cost to every step — and so are the collector's categories, which are on another clock. Against the run's elapsed time the ratio climbs toward 100% as the run lengthens no matter what the idle time does, which is why a `window="run"` point says little about how the run is actually doing.

## vLLM engine metrics (`rl.vllm.*`)

Read from the vLLM engine's own Prometheus registry, delta'd per step. `snapshot_step_metrics()` takes a baseline before generation and `get_step_metrics()` a second reading after, both fanned out to the DP-leader workers; the same snapshot pair also feeds the spec-decode metrics, so the wider coverage costs no extra RPC.

| Metric | Type | Source series |
|---|---|---|
| `rl.vllm.prompt_tokens` | Counter (`{token}`) | `vllm:prompt_tokens` |
| `rl.vllm.generation_tokens` | Counter (`{token}`) | `vllm:generation_tokens` |
| `rl.vllm.prompt_length.mean` | Gauge (`{token}`) | `vllm:request_prompt_tokens` histogram |
| `rl.vllm.generation_length.mean` | Gauge (`{token}`) | `vllm:request_generation_tokens` histogram |
| `rl.vllm.generations.ok` | Counter (`{generation}`) | `vllm:request_success{finished_reason}` |
| `rl.vllm.generations.failed` | Counter (`{generation}`) | `vllm:request_success{finished_reason}` |

The counters carry the step's delta, so summing them across steps reconstructs the run total. The means come from each histogram's `sum`/`count` delta, so they are exact rather than bucket-interpolated; a step in which the engine served no request omits them rather than reporting a zero-length sequence.

**What counts as failed.** vLLM's finish reasons are `stop`, `length`, `abort`, `error` and `repetition`. Only `stop` and `length` leave a usable sample behind, and `length` is a normal RL outcome — a rollout routinely runs to `max_tokens` — so those two are `ok` and *everything else* is `failed`. Counting the remainder rather than an explicit deny-list keeps `ok + failed` equal to the engine's own total even if a future vLLM adds a reason we have not heard of.

These are the family names vLLM registers. The reader returns family names, which `prometheus_client` strips of `_total`, so no suffixed alias is needed on this path — unlike the HTTP-scrape path in `nemo_rl/models/generation/dynamo/metrics.py`, where sample names do carry it. `test_engine_metric_names_match_vllm` checks the copies against vLLM itself. A series that matches nothing is **omitted**, leaving a visible gap in the dashboard rather than a plausible-looking zero, and so is one whose total went backwards, which means an engine restarted mid-step.

## Driver-side generation metrics (`gen_ai.*`)

The driver-side vLLM generation path records token and latency metrics through lens's `record_inference_metrics` with `provider_name="vllm"`, following the [OTel GenAI metrics spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-metrics/).

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_ai.client.token.usage` | Histogram | Tokens per request, split by `gen_ai.token.type` (`input` / `output`) |

`gen_ai.server.request.duration` is **not** recorded: it is defined per inference request, and one `generate()` call here is a batch across every data-parallel shard. That wall clock goes to `rl.vllm.batch.duration` (histogram, seconds) instead.

These overlap with `rl.vllm.*` on token counts but are not redundant: `gen_ai.*` is derived from the tensors a `generate()` call returns, so it measures what the driver received, while `rl.vllm.*` is the engine's own accounting. When the two disagree, the gap is work the engine did that never reached the driver — the aborted requests, which appear in no returned tensor at all.

These ride the normal `http/protobuf` OTLP path and reach the same backend as everything else. They are distinct from vLLM's **native** engine tracing (opt-in, and exported over vLLM's own gRPC-by-default exporter) — see [vLLM Tracing](vllm-tracing.md).

## Metric vs span tag vs resource attribute

The one rule that trips people up. Classify each value before you emit it:

| Kind | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Metric** | numerical value that changes over time | per-category efficiency seconds → `rl.efficiency.seconds` |
| **Span tag** | categorical per-span context for filtering | `rl.iteration`, `rl.bucket`, `rl.num_generations_per_prompt`, `rl.weight_version` |
| **Resource attribute** | stable for the whole run | `rl.algorithm`, `rl.model`, `dl.tensor_parallel.size` |

Do **not** put a time-series number (loss, reward) on a span attribute — it produces no useful series in your backend and wastes storage. Do **not** put a per-step categorical (iteration number) on a metric label — that is unbounded cardinality. See [lens: metrics — metric vs span attribute vs resource attribute](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Lens).

### Goodput (monitor-derived)

NeMo-RL does **not** emit `rl.goodput` or `rl.bucket.*` rollup metrics.
Leaf spans carry `rl.bucket` ∈ `{productive, overhead, idle, wasted}`;
umbrella spans (`job` / `step` / `rollout`) omit it. `rl.efficiency.seconds`
carries the same `rl.bucket` tokens, but it is a per-category duration, not a
rollup — and it needs the `rl.efficiency.measurement` filter described above.
Offline monitors (e.g. wandb-monitor) SUM span / phase GPU-time by `rl.bucket`
and compute:

```text
rl_goodput = productive_gpu_s / (productive + overhead + idle + wasted)_gpu_s
```

See [Span groups — goodput buckets](span-groups.md) and `nemo_rl/telemetry/instrumentation.py`.

Metric names use the **application scope** (`rl.*`); attribute names in the `rl.*` namespace are NeMo-RL's own, defined in `nemo_rl/telemetry/`, not imported from lens's `semconv.py`.

## Filtering across runs

Every `rl.*` data point carries the `nemo.run.id` resource attribute. Use it to isolate or compare runs in your backend (Grafana/Prometheus, or any OTLP-compatible backend). See [Configuration — Run identification](configuration.md#run-identification).
