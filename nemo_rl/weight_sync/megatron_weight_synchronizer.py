    Colocated is the degenerate path: generation either aliases the training
    weights outright (reshardless) or re-partitions them into the worker's
    dedicated inference model inside ``prepare_for_generation`` (when the
    configured inference layout/impl differs) — a genuine parallelism-changing
    transfer, but one the worker performs internally on wake. Sync therefore
    reduces to dropping training-only buffers and re-entering inference mode.

    Non-colocated generation keeps the Megatron engine lifecycle here and
    delegates the transfer to native MCore refit, packed collective, or M2N.
